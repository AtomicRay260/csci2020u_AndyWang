This is a repo made for file subbmission and activities of csci2020u

I do understand that testing and making sure code runs smoothly before commiting to repository is a good practice but due to my impacience I forgot to double check and commited mistakes on the inital commit.

Not sure what to do here because changing the history with more commits at this point may make it more messy.
I only noticed the note section after I commited.
